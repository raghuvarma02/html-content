<h2 id="intro" style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight: bold;">Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight: normal;">
	Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.

<h2 id="plot" style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight: bold;">Plot</h2>
<p style="font-family:montserrat; font-weight: normal;">
	In 2067, as humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide, it has since abandoned scientific pursuits such as space exploration. As a result, ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is now forced to work as a farmer.
	<br>
<br>
Cooper experiences a gravitational anomaly in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that they are trying to find an exoplanet capable of supporting life, and that he is working on solving a gravity equation to provide a way of transporting large numbers of people off the Earth. He enlists Cooper to pilot an exploratory spacecraft called the Endurance, equipped with two Ranger craft and one Lander craft, with a crew of three scientists: Romilly, Doyle, and Brandâ€™s daughter Amelia. This is humanity's last chance; there are no more resources to mount another expedition. A wormhole has been found near Saturn, enabling the ship to pass through into another galaxy to search for a new home.
<br><br>
On the other side, they investigate three planets orbiting a supermassive black hole, Gargantua, with each one previously being checked by a NASA scientist-explorer. Romilly remains in orbit to study Gargantua while the others take a Ranger craft to the surface. The first planet is an ocean world of shallow water. Upon arriving at the beacon and finding debris, they realize the explorer Miller is dead, and Doyle gets swept away by a tidal wave generated by Gargantua's gravity. The wave also floods the Ranger's engines, but they dry out in time for liftoff before the craft would have been destroyed. They return to the Endurance after only one hour, but 23 years have passed due to the time dilation caused by Gargantua's gravity. Back on Earth, Murph has become a scientist and begun working with Brand.
<br><br>
On the second planet, the crew awaken the explorer Mann from cryostasis. He reveals to Cooper that he lied about the planet's habitability in the hope that someone would come to rescue him. Back on Earth, a dying Brand confesses to Murph that he lied about being close to a solution for the gravity equation. He put his hopes on Cooper's team finding a habitable planet and establishing a new colony using pre-fertilized eggs. Meanwhile, Romilly dies in an explosion at Mann's camp when he attempts to access the system logs of a robot booby trapped by Mann. Mann tries to kill Cooper, escapes by stealing a Ranger and attempts to hijack the Endurance. Mann then gets himself blown up when he disregards and overrides safety warnings after failing to properly dock the Ranger. After seeing the explosion, Cooper and Brand approach in the Lander and they manage to regain control of the heavily damaged spacecraft.
<br><br>
While all hope seems lost, Cooper comes up with a plan to use the remaining Ranger and Lander crafts to execute a fuel burn, to gain the required speed needed to initiate a slingshot maneuver around Gargantua, to propel the damaged Endurance onwards to the third and final planet. However, he has to sacrifice himself by detaching and falling into the black hole to enable Brand to reach Edmunds' planet.
